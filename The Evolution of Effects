[Haskell'23] The Evolution of Effects - Nicolas Wu

=> a history of the evolution of effects handlers:
- direct
- monads & monad transformers
- algebraic effects handlers
- higher-order effects

a bit too high-level for me but a good way to hear about effects handlers, the different version, expand general programming culture and hear good programming jokes

Concept: * Denotational Semantics (the structure of the whole is the sum of the structures of the parts)

efficient algebraic effects handlers
=> fused-effects library haskell

articles that may be interesting to read:
a framework for higher(order effects & handlers
fusion for free
Effect handlers in scope
...

way to many cited for me to realistically read them all in the near future
