 Ruby Manor 3 - Programming with Nothing by Tom Stuart (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUhlNx_-wYk)

a game!
code use:
no assignement
control flow
bool
strings
arrays
numbers

allowed:
create/call procs (~lambdas)

let's write fizzbuzz!

procs:
- just move data
- currying exists
- wrapping a proc call in a proc is the same as the proc but lazy (?)

chosen syntax (translation from haskell)
(\x -> x + 1) 41 === -> x {x + 1}[41]

(basically an example of how to implement FizzBuzz with lambda calculus in Ruby as a proof of turing completeness)
