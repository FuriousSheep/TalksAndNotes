# TalksAndNotes
Notes about talks and articles and links to these talks and articles

All of the notes taken here are written using the github web UI

No roadmap but broad directions:
- make actual summaries with the main takeaways from talks/articles/books
- create an index with links to the files and the talk/article/book
